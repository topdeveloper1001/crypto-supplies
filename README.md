# Cryptocurrency circulating, available and total supplies

This is a project meant to keep track of crypto coin supply data and in a normalized format, hoping to generate community interest and involvement.

The end goal is to have a more transparent and up to date source than what's out there on the web right now.

As such, please help out by submitting a pull request with your favorite coin(s) to track.
